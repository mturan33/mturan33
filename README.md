## 👋 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from **Çukurova University** (2025) with a strong focus on **robotics, reinforcement learning, and autonomous navigation**. I specialize in implementing state-of-the-art RL algorithms from scratch and deploying them on robotic platforms.

Currently working on:
- **Quadruped Locomotion** with Isaac Lab
- **PPO** implementations for continuous control
- **Local Path Planning** benchmark (BARN dataset)

## Tech Stack

**Robotics & Simulation:** Isaac Sim • MuJoCo • Gazebo • ROS/ROS2  
**Machine Learning:** PyTorch • NumPy • Deep RL (PPO, SAC)  
**Computer Vision:** YOLOv4-8 • OpenCV  
**Platforms:** Jetson Nano • Pixhawk • Linux

## Featured Projects

### [MuJoCo Ant PPO](https://github.com/mturan33/mujoco-ant-ppo)
From-scratch implementation of **PPO** algorithm for the MuJoCo Ant-v5 environment.

**Key Features:**
- Pure NumPy & PyTorch (no stable-baselines3)
- Parallel environments (16 envs)
- TensorBoard integration
- Achieved **2700+ reward** in 8M steps

**Technical Highlights:**
- GAE (λ=0.95), reward normalization
- Clipped surrogate objective
- Learning rate annealing
- Exploration decay monitoring
